# Copy this file into inspectors, and rename it to [inspector].py,
# where [inspector] is an unclaimed handle for an IG office,
#   e.g. "usps.py" for the USPS OIG.
# Use this handle for the 'inspector' field on report dicts.

# This script's "run" function will be run.
# You can do anything you want that eventually results in calling:
#
#   inspector.save_report(report)
#
# Where report is a dict with the following required fields:
#
#   inspector: the handle you chose for the IG, e.g. "usps"
#   agency: the agency the report relates to.
#           This can be the same value as the inspector field, but it
#           may differ -- some IGs monitor multiple agencies.
#   report_id: a unique ID for the report
#   title: title of report
#   url: link to report
#   published_on: date of publication
#   year: year of publication
#   file_type: 'pdf' or other file extension
#
# Any additional fields are fine, and will be kept.
